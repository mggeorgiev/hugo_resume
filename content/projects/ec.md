approach: ["Considering the nature of the application - a database one, I decided to use the Oracle 11g XE that comes with a preinstalled APEX and a web server, that unfortunately requires a license to use SSL."
            ,"To use SSL I deployed an Apache running on Ubuntu server 16.04, that acts as a reverse proxy and SSL offloader. The certificate was obtained from Let's Encrypt."
            ,"Power BI report is available and could be updated from a reporting server, while the later is feed from the application database."]
