description: "Business site created using Hugo Static Website generator."
about: ["The site presents the business and the products of a bakery in Sofia. Facilitates the customer to choose and pre-order. Integrates with Google Analytics."
]
motivation: 
        ["Improve the existing web site. Facilitate the planning of business processes and the customer experience."]
challenges: ["The first challenge was to build a data layer that could be used for statistical analysis of data."
            ,"The second challenge was to be able to apply statistical analysis on the whole dataset while retaining each user's data private."
            ,"The third challenge was to use architecture and design that allow future changes."]
approach: ["First, I created and deployed a small web site. This approach limits the functionality but compensates with speed and also serves as a backup in case the site needs to be urgently redeployed on Azure storage."
          ,"A third party service was used to send messages - https://formspree.io/. I had to create verification on the form."
          ,"Then I created and added a Google Analytics ID to better understand the audience."]
