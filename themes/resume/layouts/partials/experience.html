                <p>
                    As a Change Manager I had to ensure that projects/change initiatives meet objectives on time and on budget. My focus was on the people side of change –
                    including changes to business processes, systems and technology, job roles and organization structures. The primary responsibility was to create and implement
                    change management strategies and plans that maximized success rate and minimized risk of service disruption. The main goals were:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to drive faster change adoption;</li>
                    <li>to drive higher ultimate utilization and greater proficiency of the changes that impact employees;</li>
                    <li>to increase benefit realization, value creation, ROI and the achievement of results and outcomes.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    As an MSI change manager I had to execute the above responsibilities on behalf of the customer in his multi-supplier environment and make sure that the
                    suppliers adhere to the agreed process. On top of the regular Change Advisory Boards (CAB) I also chaired operational review meetings.
