        <p class="mb-0">In my spare time, I work as a freelance web developer and data analyst.</p>
        <p>Some of my projects are:</p>

        <p>
            <a href="/projects/fleet-management/">FLEET MANAGEMENT</a> – database applications using Oracle 11 XE and Application Express 5.
            Database design (adherence to DB Normal forms), starts, and snowflakes.
            Creation of tables, indexes, triggers, procedures, sequences, UI.
            The application is exposed to desktop and mobile.
            As this version of Oracle XE does not support HTTPS, a reverse proxy server based on Apache was deployed and configured as a SSL off-loader.
            Certificates are based on Let’s Encrypt.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similar applications include utilities and finance management.
            All applications feed to a read-only reporting server based on MySQL.
            Visualizations are created using Power BI.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="/projects/ec/">EC-TH</a> – Property management platform. The service uses a combination of Razor Views and REST APIs to demonstrate how to modernize applications for
            scalability and cloud and how to expose services via APIs, what is the difference between XML and JSON, Pascal and Camel notations, Code First vs Database
            First migrations etc.
            <br />
            <b>Technologies</b>: .Net Framework, Bootstrap 4, Entity Framework, Microsoft SQL, jQuerry. Implementation on Azure WebApp + Azure SQL.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b><u>Contoso University</u></b> showcase project for .Net Framework based on the Microsoft MVC tutorial. My implementation uses different approaches compared with
            the suggested by Microsoft as I find their approach risky for production deployment when using code first migrations.
